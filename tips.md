1. use the index to represent the state of the input instead of use different input
2. the definition of the variable is clear and it will have impact on how we use it. Can't move forward without having the variable defined properly
3. be careful about the arbitrary value in the implementation. Normally it is not right.
4. sort out the logic under different condition(if else)
5. every info in the problem should be useful and it will help us to come up with a solution.
6. for the new question, firstly think if we could solve it with brute force.
7. the initial state is related to the edge case(input = 0)
8. list in python is not hashable
9. set() has add() member function
10. if we could confirm that our algorithm is correct, when we need to implement, we need to care about the details
11. dfs with memo, first come up with dfs and then add memorization as additional
12. index should always larger than or equal to 0
13. think about the binary represent of a value may inspire a solution
